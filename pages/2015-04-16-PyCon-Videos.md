description: The best videos from PyCon2015 - Pt 1. 

The following is a short rundown of the PyCon2015 presentations I found most inspiring, in no particular order. Please add yours to the list if you have a favorite.

####[You can find all of these videos on the YouTube channel here!][1]

###Jacob Kaplan-Moss (@jacobian)

[<strong>Keynote</strong>][4]

I really enjoyed this keynote. Essentially Jacob is arguing for the need for more adequate programmers, people who know how to do their job, who come in and do it well and go home. The shortage in talent won't be solved by filling positions with 10x-ers. We need more people in the middle. 

###Sasha Laundy (@sashalaundy)

[<strong>Your Brain's API: Giving and Getting Technical Help</strong>][3]

This is a talk about asking for help, which is very difficult in any setting. It's a very approachable talk. Some tips include: 1. pay attention to culture and pick it deliberately; 2. ask early if you don't know; 3. project consfidence; 4. get feedback when your thing is 30% done. Finally, give some sense of what you've already done and your current understanding - it gives you a way into the conversation. 

###Geoff Gerrietts (@ggerrietts)

[<strong>Performance by the Numbers: analyzing the performance of web applications</strong>][2]

Geoff presents some common approaches to increasing performance. Approaches such as the 'Drunken Man,' 'The Hammer', and 'Root Cause' analysis. He also goes through several examples of programs for measuring performance of your site, it's a useful talk for a refernce on performance.
