description: Happy (Chinese) New Year! Here's my resolutions and some impressive data visualizations.


###Xinnian Kuai Le!

Partly because I hadn't done it for our Western New Year's and partly
because today is the Chinese New Year I have put together a set of
resolutions anyone reading this can call me out next year (Year of
the Monkey).

####Health

* Complete two sprint triathlons and one Olympic triathlon.
* Complete four half-marathons.

* Improve my programming skill levels in Ruby and Python, along with general Object Orientated Programming.
* Lay out a three- five- and ten- year plan for my career.

###The Great Migration

My wife will occasionally tell me stories about how city-dwellers leap at the chance to obtain their tickets home, how the busiest streets in the world empty, and the people
return to the countryside for the holiday. It must be eerily quiet within the usually bustling metro system where traffic guards watch over the lines. I believe these stories of course, but seeing the migration from the angle in the image below really highlights the magnitude of the Chinese New Year. This image was created by China's version of Google (Baidu) mapping out the migration in what
appears to be realtime.

I'd like to create one of these transportation
maps. Leave me a note in the comment section if you think of a way to do it. [Here's the link to the actual site.][1] And you can learn more about China and it's history from my favorite Chinese podcaster [Lazlo Montgomery.][2]
