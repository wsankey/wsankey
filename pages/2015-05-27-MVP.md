description: Aim to build your Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ASAP

More and more I've taken to a term I've recently learned, MVP: Minimum
Viable Product. The idea behind the MVP is to knock out as quickly as
you possibly can the idea you've had in the back of your mind. Once
you've identified the need you are going to fill, the problem you are
going to solve, or the technology you are going to introduce go ahead
and move as fast as your will can travel to producing the most minimal
item you can that you are not embarrased to show off.
