description: The ups and downs of contributing to open source, all the time. 

*A recent picture of my contributing history on Github. I contribute as often as I can but tell myself not to worry about continually green squares.*

Whether you're a regular contributor to multiple projects or a coding newbie you'll often hear people say:

#*Contribute early and often.*

##Benefits: Many and varied
There certainly are benefits in regularly contributing to open-source projects. The two benefits that come to mind most readily are the increased web-presence you will obtain and the increased chance of having surprising opportunities come to you by virtue of participating in this community. 


###Presence
Google yourself and see how many pages of results you have to go through to find your name. It's just about the first thing people do after meeting a new interesting person, whether for employment or dating. 

Employers, friends, and the curious **will** look your profile up online. A consist record of committing will get you noticed, especially if you're looking for a job. There are even algorithms scraping these sites searching for undiscovered talent. They base their findings off of, amongst other measures, committing consistency.

###Surprising opportunities
Of course it'll help with your job search but other opportunities will come to you that you might not yet be able to appreciate. By operating consistenly in this community you might find a project that is the embodiment of something you've always wanted to do, you might discover a new way of solving that problem at work that's been bugging you for weeks, you may even generate ideas for something entirely different. And by contributing regularly you are honing the programming craft. It is a **craft** after all similar to carpentry or baseball--the more you practice the better you'll get. 

I personally have been approached to help edit and comment on a technical book. When the project is done I'll have a phsyical copy of a published book I helped edit. This opportunity came around *simply because I had an open-source record* in the topic they were writing about. You never know what's going to happen when you show up. 

##Drawbacks: **BURNOUT**
![github contributions](/assets/media/burnout.png)

Burnout is the big one. This is the feeling of being completely drained, not caring about your work, your professionalism, or your health anymore. It is the feeling of just wanting everything you're doing to stop. For projects *to be done.* It's the daydreaming of stopping the meeting you're in, walking out of the room, and moving to the wilderness. It can make you never want to contribute again. And once you start coming out of burnout and *start worrying about how much contributing you've missed* you may never want to join the community again. It is a vicious cycle that I have experienced and one that I try to preemptively avoid and remedy when I'm showing early signs.

It also doesn't help to contribute daily if what you're contributing is garbage. There are bad ways of practicing. There is such a thing as bad form. The desire to contribute should not overwhelm your general standards of well-tested and liberally documented code. 

##The Verdict

I'll continue to contribute as often as I 
can without burning through my energy and reserves. I try to stick to a general routine each day. I know my contribution is coming, and if I miss it because something came up? Whatever. It's fine. 

It helps that I enjoy contributing to open source, I enjoy writing these blog
posts but I am completely aware that continued appreciation
of both requires that I take a break sometimes. Even the most
zealous advocates need a holiday.
