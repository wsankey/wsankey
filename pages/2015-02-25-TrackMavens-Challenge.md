description: Notes from TrackMaven's monthly meetup about mobile.


Every month I attempt to make and present at [TrackMaven's Monthly
Challenge meetup][3] here in D.C. The idea for the meetup is that TrackMaven
picks a topic, usually a specific technology or framework, but not always, and let's
the community decide how to interpret and address the challenge. I've
had time in the past to participate in the [Visualization][1] and
[ElasticSearch][2] challenges and made some headway on projects that
were ultimately not mature enough to participate. The Researcher App
tutorial series I am working on was originally intended to be finished
in time for this Monthly Challenge.

It seemed that most participants were excited about
developing apps using the Ionic Framework. For example, **Fletcher
Heisler** was able to get the TrackMaven feed into an Ionic application
fairly easily. [He also provides a great tutorial for getting started.][6] The most polished app of the night, TweetCheck, had been an ongoing project from **Andrew Baker**. The motivation for this app is to give more supervisory power to an organization's twitter feed--you don't want your buzzed intern tweeting out profanities against your compeitotrs. [Especially if your competitors are a nationally known nonprofit.][5] 

Two presenters deviated from using Ionic, with mixed results. **[Josh Finnie][4]**
presented a relatively basic app he created with the Titanium framework
that had difficulties rendering dynamic images--not a good
recommendation for the framework. Meanwhile **Chris Nguyen** presented an android app
that I'd likely buy if he made it availbale on the Play Store. The app
*Color Clock* is a live wallpaper mapping the time of the day to a
specific color. As the day changes from morning to night your wallpaper
changes from red to green to blue. Chris built this app in Java.

####The next monthly meetup challenge theme is 'Chaos.' I'll post what I devise.
Let me know how you would approach this theme in the comment section!
