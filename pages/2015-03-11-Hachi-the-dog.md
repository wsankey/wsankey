description: What is it about this movie that is so touching.


*If you don't want to read the rest of this article about Hachiko the dog
you can take away these two points:<br>
1. Hachi reflects our ideal of absolute loyalty and shows us the crippling pain of loss;<br>
2. The story is **focused** on death which our culture attempts to
   hide.*

One of my wife's latest hobbies is following puppy and dog stories. She regularly scours [dog rescue youtube videos][1] and posts pictures of cute puppies from our local rescue on Facebook and other media. Recently she's moved on to watching movies. Two days ago it was the [Benji movie saga][3] and yesterday it was the story of [Hachiko][4].

For the unfamiliar, Hachi was a dog who saw his owner off at the train station every day since he was a pup. When he turned two years old his owner, a professor, died suddenly never to return from the train ride again. But for the next ten years the dog obediently arrived at the train station each day to wait to see if his owner would somehow come and pick him up. He waited there until his death.

You don't have to know anything more about this story to see now this would be a real tear-jerker of a movie. 
There is a respectable man, a professor, dying suddenly at a relatively young age. A cute young dog unexepectedly and cruelly put out on the street. There is undying loyalty and childlike ignorance of the situation.

Because Hachi is a dog we don't place on him the same expectations of growing, learning, and finding new life and love as we would a young child put through the same ordeal. As I mentioned in the beginning:

###Hachi's character synthesizes the emotions of loss and loyalty to their core.
These are emotions we are free to feel because they lack the overtones that muddy our emotional waters in human stories. Nearly everyone can relate to a dog.

Finally, the story is **focused** on death which our culture attempts to hide (look around, there's evidence of this everywhere) and in it's better moments forces us to reflect on our own mortality.
