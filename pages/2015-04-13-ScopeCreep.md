##Boiling the Ocean
*To waste one's time attempting to do the impossible. Scope is too big to do in one project. Break it up into more than one Donâ€™t try to solve every problem at once. Identify a couple, address them, and move on. You're wasting my time. You might as well be boiling the ocean.*<br>

When you first start thinking about data science projects you might be
tempted to undertake a project with too wide a scope. Here are some
examples of projects with scopes that are far too wide:

* Predicting future economic activity of Maryland
* Determining which foods are associated with cancer
* Ranking which clean technologies will fight climate change the most

And here are some project ideas that have a limited scope:

* Predicting three years of economic activity for Maryland's ports
* Conducting a meta-analysis of articles studying which foods are
  associated with cancer
* Determining the future capacity of American made solar panels
