description: We are being catalogued, measured, categorized and stored away for purposes that have yet to be imagined. 

####A passing question I posed to twitter.
![github contributions](/assets/media/measurements.png)

Knowingly or not we are being measured by multiple entities whose goals are at times unclear. From birth till death, from waking through sleeping your information is being catalogued and categorized. These entities range from governments and government agencies to private firms, to the objects we buy, our family and friends and finally to ourselves. A lot of the time we do it to ourselves. We supply the information willingly to anyone who cares to listen. 

Importantly, we have not yet arrived at a status quo, both at the amount of information measured and who is doing the measuring. This is likely an accelerating trend of previous patterns. The amount of information being collected about you by different actors is increasing the same manner that bacteria divide and divide again.  Information previously inaccessible, such as the data stored in images online, will soon come to market. Even now there are Kickstarter projects (see video at end of article) that are opening these floodgates to those who can afford access. It will not stop with images. New sensors will be devised to quantify previously uncalculable areas of our human experience. 

##So this is a general list of who is collecting what information on us.
This is a work in progress, and I want your feedback. So please leave
any additions you think about in the comments. I am being as general as
possible up-front, which will allow us to appreciate the broad
picture. I've organized this list by entity and then by type of data
being collected (again, being very broad about it). 

###**Federal, State, and Local Governments**
* Email, text and phone metadata (numbers called when and where).
  Vehicle make and model, earnings, employer(s). Where we live, who we
live with, our races and sex, whether they have disabilities or not.
Where we've traveled and with whom. Our crimes, our pardons. Schools
we've attended, degrees earned and how much we paid and to whom.
Organizations we belong to, our political leanings and aspirations. Almost all there is to know about our health if we're in certain programs, including chronic conditions, perscriptions filled--where, when, and for how long. Disease I've had and the vaccinations I've received or didn't.

###**Private firms**
* What we buy and how much we pay for it. What we want to buy. This
  includes preferences for food, clothing, entertainment, housing,
travel, and everything else that can be paid for. With algorithms these
companies can infer much more about us. 

####Social Networks
* Friends, relatives, the things we like and dislike, where we click and on what. A
  treasure trove of photos we post or approve of. When and where we need a
taxi and where to. The food we're eating. The places we've been and where we want to
go. Our comment histories and so a trove of information on our
personalities and everything you can infer from that information. 

###**Personal Trackers**
* Steps taken, heart rate, location, distance traveled, stairs
  climbed, hours slept, food eaten, pounds lost/gained. Our goals and
wealth. 

###**Other?**
* [Let me know what you think should be here by posting in the comment
  section.]

*For I have known them all already, known them all:*<br>
*Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,*<br>
*I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;*<br>
*I know the voices dying with a dying fall*<br>
*Beneath the music from a farther room.*<br>
  *So how should I presume?*<br>
