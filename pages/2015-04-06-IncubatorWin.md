description: My team created and successfully pitched the winning data product. 


For the past three months I've been working nights and weekends on a
data product for the

###[District Data Labs (DDL) Incubator Program][1] 
*Which you should totally participate in if you're in the D.C. area and
even marginally interested in data science.*

Well, this past weekend my team successfully pitched the winning data
product. You can find the app below [or live here][2].

Winning is great, but applying programming and visualization techniques I've been learning - and working on meaningful a project - is where I find fulfillment.
