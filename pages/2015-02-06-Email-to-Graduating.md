description: My general advice to students graduating with a masters in public policy.

*Hi! I am going to graduate this May and I am looking for a job now. I am wondering if you can give me some suggestions? How did you find your current job? What courses do you think are especially important for job-seekingï¼ŸWhen it comes to interview, what characteristics do you think you impress the interviewer ? How do you like your current job? Do your job deal a lot with data analysis? 
Thank you so much!*

I get this question often enough from students graduating from the
Master's in Publicy Policy program from Johns Hopkins University (the
same I graduated from) that I decided to formalize and post
my reply. The following is taken from advice I gave to the last student who asked.

* I found my current job from the Bloomberg listserv. You should be on that email list and look for offerings at smaller companies. There you'll have less competition. However, these companies rarely offer sponsorship--which you may or may not need. With smaller companies you should not be afraid to email these firms directly as they are generally always looking for extra help. Your application might get lost at larger companies.

* I always recommend technical statistical classes. Hands-on courses for Stata, SAS, or R are best though programming in other topic areas is fine. Look for courses that have a semester-long project that you can show off at an interview. I do not recommend higher level mathematics courses if you are not programming. 

* When interviewing I look for technical ability. Have you completed a quantitative analysis using Stata, SAS, or R? Can you talk me through that project and specifically what your contribution was to that project. You're just coming out of the MPP program so we don't expect too much experience but I do expect you to have a project that you can talk about at length. This project should feature prominently on your resume. 

* My current job is fantastic. As I mentioned I'm at a small firm so I have a hand in all of the quantitative projects our company produces. I work on projects from their conception to their completion, from writing the proposal to writing the final report and presenting it to our clients. Life at smaller firms can be stressful but you will learn a lot. I work with data every day using Stata, SAS, and R.
