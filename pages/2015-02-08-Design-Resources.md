description: Sites for finding the right color and typeface.


As the first things people see when visiting your site, color scheme and font play a large role in setting tone. Once you have an idea of the message you're trying to get across the to the viewer I recommend the following resources for for finding the right colors and typeface to match your message. The first is Adobe Kuler which provides an interactive way to find colors. As someone barely able to match his clothes in the morning I recommend going to the 'explore' section of the site and choosing one of the popular schema already laid out. That is exactly how I found the color scheme you are viewing now. 

I don't have a specific site for typeface but I always attempt to match Serif and Sans Serif fonts for greater visual affect. After reading some articles on the best combinations of Google Fonts I've decided on Lustri and Lato. I may pay for fonts in the future, they are that important, but not until this blog has some more active readership!
