description: How to find projects that will improve your skills and beef your resume.


You, as the Beginning programmer, will reach a point in your learning arc where
you'll move away from coding problems and begin looking for manageable projects to contribute. Oftentimes the
field looks so complex and full that you'll be overwhelmed, you'll feel
that you couldn't possible contribute to projects, your own will feel
inferior in comparison. To overcome these feelings and *start working*
I've compiled a list of resources where I've found fertile ground. 

* Local Meetups: After sporadically attending different meetups in my
area, Washington DC, I found two that are full of projects I could
actively help out on. The first is *Code for DC* a meetup dedicated to
serving the community with technology. Example projects include a
real-time election map, streamlining subsidized housing forms, and ....
The other is TrackMaven's monthly challenge meetup that takes a new
technology, service, or method and asks members to create something to
show off for the next meetup. This has been a great source of project
ideas--the technology piece is already set, you have to use python's
natural language processing package (for example)--and the challenge is
to do something with it. 

* Internet forums. Check out the discussions being held on Reddit
  /r/webdev and CodeNewbie.org. There's plenty of folks looking for
partners on projects across a range of technologies.

* Twitter. Through twitter I applied to a local technology incubator
  program and was accepted. I am now in the District Data Labs Incubator
program building a data product with three other team members. I would
neve have heard of, let alone applied, to this *free* activity if I had
not been keeping up with my social media presence on twitter. 

* Youtube. I've been able to practice my Ruby on Rails skills from
  Mackenzie Child's 12 in 12 Challenge hosted for free on youtube.com
Mackenzie challenged himself to create and publish 12 apps in 12 weeks.
He succeeded and posted one video each week documenting how he creates
each app. He replicates twitter, reddit, dribbble, and creates several
distinct apps himself. If you are lacking for ideas or need really in
depth tutorials you should search youtube before proceeding to the next
point. 

* Paid services. I have paid for subscriptions to Treehouse, CodeSchool,
  Vim Adventures, and Pluralsight in addition to outright purchasing
books and tutorials from Zed Shaw's *Learn the Hard Way* series and from
the guys over at *Real Python*. There are plenty of free services, but
if you're serious about your learning you should consider some of these
paid sites. I'll have a more detailed comparison of these materials in
later posts. 

Finally when all else fails I peruse the popular repositories on Github
and see what others have been doing. It is not a bad idea to see how
others structure their projects and think through their programming.
