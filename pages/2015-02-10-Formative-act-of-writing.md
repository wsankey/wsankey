description: You need to write well.



The ability to clearly communicate an idea is a skill you need in order to advance in your personal and professional projects, especially if they relate to data science and development. Writing well reflects on your understanding and respect for what you are communicating. It is indicative of an organized mind. Your message may still come across if you never capitalize proper nouns or fail to use proper grammar but it's likely you won't be as well received or respected. You might not even understand what you are trying to say. When reviewing code on Github I can usually tell the shape of the repository by how well the readme is constructed. I dread those repositories that have a scattered, incomplete readme because it usually means the code is in similar disarray. Nowadays your own words form the first impression people make of you. Writing down your argument for or against a particular stance will reveal its strengths and weaknesses to you. It may help you solve that problem that's been bothering you for half the day. To paraphrase G.K. Chesterton, sometimes all it takes to win an argument is repeating the opponent's stance back to them in written form.

There are plenty of diatribes on the benefits of clear communication, but the one I have begun to appreciate is that *writing helps me understand my grasp of a particular subject.* Essentially, I don't understand my own understanding of an idea until I begin to write about it. In the coming weeks I will begin writing about developing an app in the Ionic framework. I know this will take me quite some time to complete because I do not know the gaps in my knowledge I will need to fill. Even for languages and frameworks I think I understand, writing reveals my ignorance.

In short, you need to learn how to write well. Practicing writing involves
uncovering your own ignorance and is an entirely humbling, and welcome,  experience.
