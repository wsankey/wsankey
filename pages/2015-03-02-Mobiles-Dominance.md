description: Or, the importance of the Ionic and React Native frameworks.

If you commute into work using public transportation then you already know. Just look
around and you'll see women applying their makeup, men reading the
newspaper, and teenagers listening to their headphones. You'll also see,
most of the time, people absolutely buried in their phones. Hunched over browsing
Reddit, Facebook, and Twitter or playing bejeweled games that vibrate and flash. People do this all the time in almost all situations. This is not news. 

However, the speed of smartphone adoption globally *is* news. [A recent
report by the Economist magazine reports that:][1]

###By 2020 80% of adults WORLDWIDE will have a smartphone.

This is not the distant future, this is the **near** future. And the
coming complete dominance of mobile communications warrants a
well-equipped workforce. A workforce that the U.S. does not seem to have
at the moment. [The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) estimates that software engineers will grow at
20% in the coming year][2] and even then there will be worldwide demand
for more mobile engineers. 

This is why I have subtitled this article the importance of Ionic and
React Native frameworks because

###they allow software engineers to more easily develop for mobile.

So that the front-end designer can help bring the iOS app to market or
the professional pythonist can deploy on android. 

And this is also a reason why more diversity is needed in development
generally, because the rise of the mobile platform is a **global
phenomenon** and we need individuals designing solutions to problems
specific to their culture and demographic. There are more apps designed to resolve the problems middle-class twenty-somethings are facing then there are for the retiring pensioners whose problems might be easily resolved with a simple app. Mobile usage is growing across the countries in Africa and in the population dense cities of India and China. Those software engineers who can capture these markets will capture the future. 

Frameworks such as Ionic and React Native are important because they
will allow professionals and hobbyists across the world to design mobile
solutions.

[Here is the Ionic Framework forum that I usually hang out in.][3]

And below is a video introducing React Native, which is not available
for public use as of this posting.
