description: How I moved away from Wordpress on GoDaddy to Jekyll on Github.

I just finished the move away form Wordpress hosted on GoDaddy to Jekyll hosted on Namecheap (using Github pages) and it feels great. Wordpress and GoDaddy are great services, but I wanted a blogging platform built around Ruby that would be infinitely customizable and under my control.The only compromise I made was in not having a What-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) writing interface, instead I'm learning markdown to write these posts.

And to be honest I think it's a good challenge to dive into something you're not entirely sure about. I'm learning markdown quickly and have used the principles of markdown, as I'm sure you have, already when writing notes in textpad or any other basic editor.

Namecheap's site is easy to navigate and they have a knowledgebase in case you'd like to look something up. Whereas GoDaddy always seems to be selling me something I trust Namecheap to help me out when I need it. 

A Github account and a little bit of coding knowledge and you'll have your Github pages blog up in minutes.
