description: Observations for success in your mentorship.

I have been both mentor and mentee. Both roles are rewarding and
frustrating in their own way. Both are natural roles you take on when
becoming a professional in your craft. This post examines what you can do as a
mentee to make sure you have a positive, fulfilling experience. 


###1. You have to know what you want
Your mentor doesn't know what you want, your parents don't know what you
want, your spouse might not even know what you want. You have to sort
that out for yourself before devoting yourself to being mentored, in
anything. There's a W.E.B DuBois quote I like to think about when I'm
considering specializing in a certain language afraid that I'm missing
out on other opportunities, the quote is "**Nature must needs make men a
little narrow to give them force.**" Specializing will cut off other
opportunities for you, but it's necessary in order to become a
professional. 

###2. You have to do your homework
You should know about the
topic or subject you're being mentored in. A corollary to this rule
is that **You have to know who to ask.** And then you have to follow the
advice of your mentor. You have to practice. You have to trust they know
what they are recommending. You have to trust the thing you're studying
is know-able and that by being diligent you will understand it. 

###3. You have to speak up
And ask questions. You gain respect and notice for asking the tough or
seemingly stupid questions. It's often the case that (when you're in a
group) everyone else is just as confused as you are and others are
relieved when you ask. If you're really at a loss for what to say ask
your mentor about themselves. People really love talking about
themselves and their projects, and they'll like you more because of it. 

###4. You have to be quiet
And listen. To what I'm telling you to do
  and what I'm telling you not to do. You have to know
what battles are worth fighting and which are not. I'm not recommending
you lose your sense of self, what I'm saying is that you need to be
humble. 

###5. It never ends
Your contractual relationship with your mentor may have a specified end
date but that doesn't mean your relationship is necessarily over.
Remember your mentor is a person and values relationships. They want to
see you succeed and there is a lot to learn from them outside of your
chosen professional.
