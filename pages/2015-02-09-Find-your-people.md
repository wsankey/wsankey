description: Join online communities for professional development.


The advantage of being part of several distinct online communities is
that I can reach out anytime to ask questions, answer questions, seek
advice, give advice, learn about activities and just generally grow my
data and development skills. The following are communities I participate in on at least a semi-regular basis:

* Data
    * Stackoverflow: This is *the* place to search for answers when
      you are stuck. I've found that about 90 percent of the time I find
someone with the same seemingly insurmountable problem I'm currently
facing. The other ten percent were instances where I did not understand
what I wanted or the problem was a fundamental misunderstanding on my
part. 
    * Statalist and the SAS listserv: For those working with Stata or SAS
      you will find these communities priceless when you have a question
you just cannot answer. These forums are online (Stata) or hosted via
email (SAS). Typically you will have some guidance within hours of
posting; but beware to follow posting guidelines becasue these prickly
communities want questions posed in just the right way.

* Development
    * Open communities: By 'open' I mean free. These include the
      Codenewbie and Codeschool forums, IRC channels, and /r/webdev on
Reddit. They each generally have good content and discussion but
sometimes it is hard to hear above the constant noise. Of all the forums
I mentioned I recommend Codenewbie the most--they continually provide
great discussions on programming topics and offer free coding sessions
with other newbies and a top-notch podcast.  

    * Gated communities: And by 'gated' I mean not-free. The two that
      I have been experimenting with are the Ruby Rogues forums and the
recently launched forum created by Mackenzie Child. The Rogues have
given me a significant amount of value through their podcast and the
forum itself has paid for itself through great advice and free trials
at different learning websites (e.g. one user was giving away monthly
trials of Pluralsight). Mackenzie Child has created a significant amount
of value through his 12 in 12 app challenge, enough so that I felt the
need to give his forum a chance. It is still too early to see if that
will pay off in the long-run.
