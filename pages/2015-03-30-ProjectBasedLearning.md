###After learning the basics embrace the baptism by fire

The most frustrating and rewarding class I ever took occurred during my first semester of
my master's program and it was centered around a project. The idea for
the class, in addition to refining our writing techniques through
grueling memoranda, was to throw students into the deep end of a policy problem. We were directed to identify the conditions of
three distinct neighborhoods around Baltimore city before and after the
recession and determine how they fared.

Like most projects, the problem statement was innocuous enough but the execution proved a
bear. Like most innocuous problem statements this one hid layers of
competing findings, frustrating collaboration and coordination with
peers, and required making difficult decisions on design and procedure.
It kept me and my teammates up late nights, it was the cause of a few
breakdowns, and it softened our respective freshman ideas about graduate
school.

Experienced workers know these feelings and probably remember their
first tango working with a difficult problem on a team of competing
personalities. But for those who don't, know this:

###Although it is extrememly trying at times, this is the fastest and most complete way to learn. 

If you are hoping to become a data scientist or experienced developer, work on related
projects. Here are some ideas:

* [Python Tutorials][1]
* [Data Science and Analysis Tutorials (with Python)][2]

###You need to get started, right away. 

*Do what you can, with what you have, where you are*
