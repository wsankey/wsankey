description: There is a dense layer of vocabulary defending the central ideas.


##Shibboleth
*a word or custom whose variations in pronunciation or style can be used to differentiate members of ingroups from those of outgroups. Within the mindset of the ingroup, a connotation or value judgment of correct/incorrect or superior/inferior can be ascribed to the two variants.*<br>
~Wikipedia

Every profession has it's own terms particular to that specialty. And it's natural that as a specialty soaks in new concepts and ideas it create these terms to detail specific ideas. There are important nuances in ideas that need to be defined and articulated; just as two different species of the Iris flower have different color patterns and petal widths so too do different model methods, data structures, and classification strategies have differences that matter. 

However, at times it seems like new terms are created just for the purpose of creating walls. Language is a curreny between insiders passed around to the detriment of anyone who wants to join the discussion. Sometimes it seems that data science is hard because we have terms that appear to be more useful for protecting those with established titles than creating distinctions between ideas.

And so I encourage you, if you are willing to pursue this ambitious career to learn distinctions between terms. And once you are established, please explain your ideas in the simplest terms possible--but not simpler.
