description: How to think about making an assessment.  


Recently I was asked to assess a program I have been participating in
over the past few weeks, we are just about halfway through the work and now it's time to reflect. It was a set of three general questions without formal
metrics, survey, or scale I could use as a guide. The questions were
general, overarching: 'How is your team dynamic?', 'Are you satisfied with your
product?', and 'What else do you need to be successful?' Needless to say
(because I'm writing this blog post) these questions were
confounding. And I had quite a bit of trouble answering them coherently. 

Generally I am satisfied with the program, I enjoy my team dynamic and
think we are progressing fine. I think we're creating a quality product.
What is confounding to me is the question of standards, of **what else
could we be doing to make this product better.** This is the thought
that interrupts my thinking. How can I make an accurate assessment
without having a benchmark to compare this experience against. How would
I know if we are going in a wrong direction? What else *could* we be
doing to improve this product? I stalled answering the question until I
realized:

###I have enough other experiences to use as comparison

I've worked as a project manager and team member for years both
academically and professionally. I know the feeling of being the only
one who cares about a project. I know the nagging voice in the back of
my mind when a project stalls. And I don't have those reserverations
now. **And yet, I know we could do better.** We could get more
stakeholder buy-in, we could put our product in front of other teams and
mentors. We could add more features and improve the features we have
already built.

And maybe these realizations are the point of making assessments. Taking
time to reflect on how you are doing, when you really care about what
you are doing, is important in order to refocus and re-energize. Yes,
even though we are progressing rapidly there are things we could be doing better and **here is what I think
they are.** I am grateful this assignment was more than
filling in a few bubbles on a survey because it's given me time to make
an actual assessment.
