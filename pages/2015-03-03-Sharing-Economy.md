description: Millennials are increasing the number of sharing services available around the globe.


I regularly listen to Dan Benjamin on the 5by5.tv network and for each show he'll sell the audience on a couple of sponsorships. Usually I tune out while he reads them off but one of his newest sponsors had me listening attentively. The sponsor was the [Five Four Club][1] a service for men who don't like to shop for clothes. I don't need this service but if I had enough spare capital lying around I might participate in it. It wasn't the product exactly that I was interested in, what struck me was the fact that a legitimate company could be formed around sending men clothes each month in the mail.

For a person who has only ever bought clothes from a physical store after spending an annoying amount of time going, parking, trying on, reselving, talking to sales people, deciding on color, deciding on price, etc. For a person so used to that traditional model to realize that a company can be formed around sending clothes **each month** to men who have never tried these items on served as a realization. Specifically that 

##all traditional service models can be reshaped by these contemporary forces.

In a very real way. 

Dan also regularly recommends other monthly services that
deliver straight to your home so you don't have to go to crowded stores
and wade through the plethora of substandard projects -- examples of
these delivery services range from [razors from Harrys][2] to
[mattresses from Casper][3]. And there are abundant other examples: [in certain cities there are food delivery
services][8]. In almost all cities across the United States there are ride
sharing services, think [ZipCar][4] or [Car2Go][5]. But why not just [Uber][6] it or even bike around using a bike sharing service. You can book a room easily with [Airbnb][7] and find a date from a range of apps.

There has been a lot written about these changing trends. But it wasn't
until I heard Dan read about a service that will send men new clothes
each month to wear that I was shocked by the reality of it. All
traditional services that can be remade **will** be remade.
